# Puzzle Input Files

Puzzle input files should be copied into text files with names according to their day, and placed into the appropriate
folder for their year.

For example, the puzzle input for year 2015 day 1, should be copied into a file named `day01.txt` and placed in
the folder `year_2015`.
